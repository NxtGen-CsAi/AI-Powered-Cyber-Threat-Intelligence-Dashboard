### Short Overview

Project Sentinel is a sophisticated, real-time threat intelligence platform designed to provide cybersecurity analysts with a dynamic and intuitive interface for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing cyber threats across the globe. By leveraging the analytical power of AI, this dashboard aggregates data from diverse sources‚Äîincluding the dark web, deep web, and surface web‚Äîto deliver actionable insights and enhance situational awareness.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Global Threat Map:** Visualize the origins of cyber attacks across a world map, with color-coded severity indicators for immediate threat assessment.
- **Dynamic Attack Trend Analysis:** Track threat volumes and patterns over time with an interactive area chart, helping to identify emerging campaigns and historical trends.
- **AI-Driven Threat Categorization:** A smart pie chart automatically classifies threats (e.g., Ransomware, Phishing, Malware), allowing analysts to quickly understand the current threat landscape.
- **High-Priority Alert Feed:** A continuously updated list of critical and high-severity alerts ensures that the most pressing threats are never missed.
- **Comprehensive KPI Dashboard:** At-a-glance statistics provide a high-level overview of key metrics, such as total threats detected, high-risk alerts, and dark web mentions, with trend indicators.
- **Responsive & Modern UI/UX:** Built with a sleek, dark-mode aesthetic and a fully responsive layout for seamless use on any device.

### Tech Stack Used

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **Data Visualization:** Recharts
-   **AI & Machine Learning:**
-   **Google AI Studio:** Utilized for prompt engineering, testing, and refining the logic for AI-driven features.
-   **API Integration:** The conceptual backbone for analyzing unstructured threat data, classifying attack types, summarizing alert descriptions, and identifying threat origins from raw data feeds.

### Skills Demonstrated

-   **AI Integration & Prompt Engineering:** Designing effective prompts to have an AI model analyze, classify, and summarize complex cybersecurity data into a structured, digestible format.
-   **Frontend Development:** Expertise in building modern, scalable, and performant user interfaces with React and TypeScript.
-   **Data Visualization:** Proven ability to transform raw data into clear, interactive, and insightful visualizations that support decision-making.
-   **UI/UX Design:** A strong focus on creating an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and user-centric interface that simplifies complex information.
-   **Problem-Solving:** Architecting a frontend application that can efficiently handle and display simulated real-time data streams for a high-stakes environment.
-   **Creativity:** Innovatively combining AI capabilities with a frontend dashboard to create a powerful and novel tool for the cybersecurity domain.

### What I Learned

This project was a fantastic opportunity to bridge the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical user interface design. Key learnings include:

-   The process of structuring prompts to get reliable, JSON-formatted output from an LLM for data-driven applications.
-   Techniques for visualizing multi-dimensional data in a way that is both informative and easy to comprehend for a specialized audience.
-   The importance of component-based architecture in React for building a modular and maintainable dashboard.
-   Balancing aesthetic design with the functional requirements of a data-heavy application.

### Future Improvements

-   **Live Data Integration:** Replace the mock data service with a live data pipeline using WebSockets to connect to real cybersecurity APIs or feeds.
-   **AI-Powered Natural Language Search:** Implement a search bar that uses the Gemini API to allow analysts to query the threat database using natural language (e.g., "Show me all critical ransomware attacks from the last 24 hours").
-   **Automated Report Generation:** Add a feature for the AI to generate detailed, downloadable PDF reports summarizing threat activity over a selected period.
-   **User Authentication & Customization:** Introduce user accounts to allow for personalized dashboards, saved filters, and role-based access control.


### Conclusion

Project Sentinel serves as a powerful proof-of-concept demonstrating how modern AI can revolutionize the field of cybersecurity intelligence. By automating data analysis and presenting it through a clean, interactive interface, this platform empowers security professionals to detect threats faster, understand attack patterns more deeply, and ultimately make more informed decisions to protect their assets. It showcases a forward-thinking approach to building next-generation security tools.
